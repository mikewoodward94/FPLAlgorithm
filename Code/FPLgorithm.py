    The aim of this project was to see how well an algorithm could do purely using fpl points.
    
    Calculates projected scores for each player for each gameweek(gw)/event/round
    and uses this to create optimal an optimal FPL team. Utilises existing teams,
    amount in bank, and available transfers.
    
    Projected scores for each player are calculated using a weighted average points per match
    from the previous 8 gameweeks (number under review, 8 chosen to capture form).
    The average points are weighted by opposing team difficulty. Team difficulties are
    split in to gk/def/att as some teams have strong offense but weak defense (or any permutation)
    meaning attackers may do well but defenders not. These team ratings are simply calculated
    as an average of the fpl points scored against them per game. The projections are
    calculated by combining the players historical scoring with their future opponents.
    
    These scores are then fed in to an optimiser that satisfies FPL logic such as position or
    team limits on players. This produces an excel workbook of squad, starting team, and captain
    for each week. Additionally visualisations are produced for fun.
